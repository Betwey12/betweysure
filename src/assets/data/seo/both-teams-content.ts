<h4 style="margin: 32px 0; font-size: 32px;">Introduction to BTTS Betting</h4>
<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Both Teams to Score (BTTS) is a simple yet profitable betting market where your bet wins if both teams score at least one goal during the match—regardless of the final result. With Betweysure, you get expertly analyzed BTTS predictions backed by team form, goal-scoring trends, and statistical data to increase your chances of winning.</p>

<h4 style="margin: 32px 0; font-size: 32px;">Why Bet on BTTS?</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Doesn’t Depend on the Match Outcome</strong> – Unlike traditional match-winner bets, you only need both teams to score—whether it ends in a draw or a win for either team doesn’t matter.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>High Odds for Value Betting</strong> – BTTS odds are often attractive, especially when betting on attacking teams with weak defenses.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Works Across Various Leagues</strong> – From top European leagues to smaller competitions, BTTS remains a profitable and widely available market.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Less Risky Than Correct Score Bets</strong> – Predicting the exact score is difficult, but expecting both teams to score is easier with the right analysis.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Ideal for Accumulator Bets</strong> – BTTS selections can be combined into an accumulator bet, increasing your potential winnings.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 32px 0; font-size: 32px;">How to Pick the Best BTTS Matches</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;">
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Look for <strong>Attacking Teams</strong> – Teams with high goal averages are great BTTS candidates.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Avoid <strong>Strong Defensive Teams</strong> – If one team is known for solid defense, they might shut out the opposition.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Check <strong>Recent Form</strong> – If both teams have scored in their last few matches, BTTS is likely.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Consider <strong>Head-to-Head Stats</strong> – Past meetings often indicate whether both teams tend to score against each other.</li>
